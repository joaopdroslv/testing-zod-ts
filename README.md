# Zod Testing Playground

This repository is a small collection of TypeScript files created to learn, explore, and experiment with Zod, a TypeScript-first schema validation library.
Each file focuses on a specific Zod feature or pattern, ranging from basic validation to more advanced use cases like refinements, transformations, unions, async validation, and recursive schemas.

## 🎯 Purpose

The goal of this repository is:
    - To serve as a hands-on reference for learning Zod
    - To test different validation scenarios
    - To understand how Zod integrates with TypeScript
    - To build reusable validation patterns for real applications
    - Feel free to modify, break, and experiment with the examples.

## 🚀 Getting Started

```
npm install
```

To execute an example:
```
npx ts-node code/simpleUsage.ts
```

Or replace the filename with any file inside the `code/` directory.
